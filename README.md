# CAN HAL for ch32

![Build](https://github.com/marti157/ch32-can-rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

Rust HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) crate for WCH's 32-bit RISC-V microcontrollers's CAN peripheral. Contains abstractions to use the CAN bus.

Implements [embedded-can](https://docs.rs/embedded-can/latest/embedded_can).

Depends on the [ch32-hal](https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal) and [PAC](https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-data) (Peripheral Access Crate).

## Examples

The `scenarios/` directory includes basic use of the HAL.
